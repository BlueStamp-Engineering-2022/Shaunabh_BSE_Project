# TableTop Robot (205)
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint. 



# Second Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.



# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.

# Starter Project
My starter project is the TV-B-Gone. It switches off Televisions when you point it at a TV. The TV-B-Gone emits a pulse of invisible light, also known as Infrared signal, which is picked up by a television, and turns it off. The microcontroller, or the computer that helps the TV-B-Gone work, was pre-programmed. I soldered all of the components in the right places to assemble it. The switch at the bottom of the circuit board restarts the TV-B-Gone. The green LED next to it, switches on to show if the device is switched on. The resistor right above it reduces the current flowing to the VCC(Common collector voltage) and GND(ground) of the microcontroller. The ceramic oscillator on the circuit board vibrates to generator an oscillating signal of a specific freqency, in this case, the frequency of infrared light. The microcontroller then sends the current through the four transistors to amplify the current to send it to the LED placed in front of it. The LEDs then emit the infrared signal. During this project, something I struggled with is soldering good joints since this was my first soldering experience, the original ceramic oscillator that the TV-B-Gone kit was sent with was defective which prevented it from working, when I switched it out the TV-B-Gone started working again. The wires on the battery pack kept snapping, so I had to solder a new wire entirely. doSomething I Enjoyed about this project, is discovering fixes to the project even when it seemeed like it wouldn't work again and soldering.
